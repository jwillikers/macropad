The configuration of my {Adafruit-MacroPad-RP2040}.
It mostly includes macros to speed up adding series works and the like to {BookBrainz} and {MusicBrainz}.

== Getting Started

The instructions here setup the software for the Adafruit MacroPad RP2040.
It is assumed that you are on and familiar with Linux and using {CircuitPython} on microcontrollers.

[TIP]
====
To access the serial connection to the MacroPad RP2040 without requiring superuser privileges, add your user to the `dialout` group.

[,sh]
----
sudo usermod --append --groups dialout $USER
----

Now restart for the change to take effect.
====

. Install {just} by following the instructions in the https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation[installation section].

. Clone this project's repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/macropad.git
----

. Change to the project's root directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd macropad
----

. Push down the rotary encoder on the MacroPad RP2040 while plugging it in to your computer with a USB-C cable or hitting the reset button to enter bootloader mode.

. To download and install CircuitPython, run `just install-circuitpython`.
+
[,sh]
----
just install-circuitpython
----

. Wait for the file to finish copying, after which the MacroPad RP2040's onboard storage should automatically be mounted.
This is mounted at `/run/media/jordan/CIRCUITPY` on my machine.

. Run `just init` to initialize the venv.
+
[,sh]
----
just init
----

. Run `just install` to install everything to the MacroPad.
+
[,sh]
----
just install
----

== Development

It's recommended to use the provided {pre-commit} checks when developing.

. Run `just init-dev` to initialize the virtual environment for development.
This will install all of the necessary dependencies and the {pre-commit} hooks.
+
[,sh]
----
just init-dev
----

. To update dependencies, run `just update`.
+
[,sh]
----
just update
----

. Use `just --list` to list other available tasks.
+
[,sh]
----
just --list
----
